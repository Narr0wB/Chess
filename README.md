# Overview
This is a chess engine and soon to be a chess ai program written in python.
The board's rendering is based off the Tkinter module, and the rules are hard coded into the GameBoard object.
I also added FEN support, in order to load a specific board, though i still have to work on the overall efficiency of the code, along with the code's cleanliness.
